# ChromeExtension0

## Considerations

- The extension wouldn't have been benefited by utilization of a framework like Next.js at this demonstration level, so It has been ommitted.
- There is a way to include user-identity in the extension using the Chrome Web Store IDs as the Client ID for the extension, but it is not free and requires a Developer Account, and so hasn't been implemented. Instead, it is generated by chrome's extension devtools.
- The calculated Extension ID is : `hhmkanjkpifpnojlmgkkgdkhdnkhhhji`
- OAuthClientID: `583176469710-psrn8f83nvojpdab0kuiv4s790gvh0eo.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- The extension is kept very basic as to not use up a lot of time.
